This project is a Hospital Patient Management System developed as part of a Data Structures course. It uses a Doubly Linked List to manage patient data and handle doctor-patient appointments.

Key Features:

Patient Management: Add, prioritize, and update patient information.
Appointment Scheduling: Assign patients to doctors and schedule appointments, with each patient having a linked appointment.
Prioritization: Patients are prioritized based on urgency, with their position in the waiting list updated every 30 seconds.
Patient History: Completed appointments move the patient to the history list.
This system allows real-time management of patient data and appointments, making it efficient for hospital staff. It was developed in collaboration with [Lana Almalki ] and serves as our first project in implementing Data Structures with Java.
